Setup your homework environment
===============================

This guide will help you install conda and create the ml conda environment
required for your homework assignments. If you have an up to date conda
version installed you can skip the first step. (To update conda run
'conda update anaconda' or if you have miniconda installed 'conda update conda'.)

a) Install Conda
----------------

Your assignments will be send to you and submitted by you as Jupyter notebooks,
which requires Python. Moreover, we need additional Machine Learning packages.

They are best managed with Anaconda:

Download and install Anaconda:
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section
that contains all important Python packages.

Alternatively: If you have limited disk space install Miniconda:
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html .

Select your Operating System under the section Regular installation on
https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html
and follow the installation instructions on the web site.


b) Setup the ml environment
----------------------------

Download ml.yml from StudIP. Then in a terminal navigate to the
directory where you saved ml.yml and run

    'conda env create -f ml.yml'


c) Activate the environment
---------------------------

Always activate the environment when you work on the homework:

    'conda activate ml'

To deactivate an environment:

    'conda deactivate'


d) Run Jupyter Notebooks
------------------------

After you installed Python and the ml environment verify you are able
to run the notebook server by opening your command line

  jupyter notebook

Usually a browser window should open up. If not, open your favorite
webbrowser and navigate to localhost:8888/tree.
